Google Cloud Print Proxy
William Wynn
CIO Technologies Inc.

Based off the prototype written by mimeoconnect:
https://github.com/mimeoconnect/Google-Cloud-Print-Proxy

Requires: Zend Framework
Scripts looks in ./Zend/. If Zend is already in the path, remove the 'require_once'
in the constructor of CIOCloudPrint.php and at the top of CIOCloudPrintXMPP.php

Optional: XMPPPHP
http://code.google.com/p/xmpphp/
Used by CIOCloudPrintXMPP.php which looks for it in ./XMPPHP/. Remove the
'require_once' at the top of the file if not needed.

CIOPrinting is an optional script for sending documents(including PDF) to any local printer. Not tested with Linux yet, but it *should* work...

The ./drivers directory contains sample ppd files for both a standard 8.5x11 and a thermal label printer.

See ./documentation for Script usage
